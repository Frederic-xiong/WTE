planned features:

1) Text Feature: once you select a recipe, option for "Text Me the Ingredients" so that you have a checklist to look out for

2) Grocer Feature: Future planned collab with Uber Eats, Doordash, or another delivery service, so that instead of having to go fufil the checklist of ingredients, it gets delivered to you; time feature (so if you get off work at 5:30pm, can set grocer deliver time to be 6:45pm)

3) GPS Feature: Will navigate you to nearest store with the available ingredients, partnering with grocery stores to implement this
